# 🧠 SVM Kernel Examples in Jupyter

This repository contains a simple Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to use different kernels with Support Vector Machines (SVM) using scikit-learn.

## 📘 What’s Inside

- ✅ Linear Kernel
- 🔁 Polynomial Kernel
- 🌐 RBF (Gaussian) Kernel
- ➕ Sigmoid Kernel

Each section includes:
- Code for training the SVM
- A quick visualization (if applicable)
- Comments explaining the differences

## 🛠️ Requirements

Install the necessary Python packages:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
